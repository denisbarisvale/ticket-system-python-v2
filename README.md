# Ticket System (Python)

This is my first real Python project.

## 🚀 My Journey

About one year ago, I tried to learn Python, but I quit very early when I was only at the “hello world / simple input” level.

After restarting Python, I decided to focus on building a real project instead of just small examples.

In 12 days, I developed this ticket system from scratch:
- Handling user input  
- Validating data  
- Using functions properly  
- Applying basic logic and conditions  
- Structuring a small but complete program  

On day 14, I took the next step and connected the project to an SQLite database.

Now the program doesn’t just run — it also **remembers**.  
This was my first experience combining Python with a real database.

This project is a milestone for me.  
It marks the moment I stopped just “trying” and started **building**.

## 🧩 Features

- Asks for user name, age, and student status  
- Validates all inputs  
- Calculates ticket price based on rules  
- Saves tickets to an SQLite database  
- Prints a clean ticket summary  
- Uses functions to keep code structured and readable  

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python ticket_system_v2.py
