# Ticket System (Python) — v2 (SQLite)

My first Python project: a simple ticket system that now saves data to an SQLite database.

## 🚀 My Journey

About one year ago, I started learning Python with excitement, but I quit very early when I was only at the “hello world / simple input” level.

After some time, I decided to start again — this time seriously.

In just 12 days, I went from basic concepts to building this project from scratch:
- Handling user input
- Validating data
- Using functions properly
- Applying basic logic and conditions
- Structuring a small but complete program

**v2 milestone:** I connected Python with **SQLite**, so the program doesn’t just run — it also **remembers**.

This is only the beginning. More versions and more advanced projects will come.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Python handles the program logic (input → validation → calculation → output)
- SQLite stores data permanently (insert, select, update, delete)
- Together: a real mini-system that both works and saves history

## 🧩 Features (v2)

- Asks for user name, age, and student status
- Validates all inputs
- Calculates ticket price based on rules
- Prints a clean ticket summary
- Saves each ticket to `tickets.db` (SQLite)
- You can view saved tickets with SQL queries

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python ticket_system_v2.py
